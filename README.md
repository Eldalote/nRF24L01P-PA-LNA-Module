# nRF24L01P-PA-LNA-Module DO NOT USE

DO NOT USE THIS DESIGN!
When doing further projects with the nRF24L01p and PA LNA module, I came to the conclusion that I made some significant design errors in this design.
The current version of the design might function, maybe, but I know for sure that there are some errors.
For a better design look at my Drone project. Both the drone PCB and the remote PCB have this module integrated on the PCB.
